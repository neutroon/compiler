**A Simple Language Scanner and Parser**

**Introduction:**

Welcome to our language scanner and parser project! This project aims to provide a simple yet functional tool for scanning and parsing a custom language using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner exploring the fundamentals of compiler design or an enthusiast working on a personal project, our tool offers an accessible way to understand the intricacies of lexical analysis and syntactic parsing.

**Features:**

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface, built with HTML and styled with CSS, offers a clean and intuitive environment. The primary code input area allows you to write code snippets for scanning and parsing.

2. **Scanner Output:** The scanner component, powered by JavaScript, tokenizes the input code and displays the resulting tokens along with their respective categories. It identifies reserved words, operators, separators, identifiers, numbers, and strings.

3. **Parser Output:** Utilizing JavaScript, the parser module attempts to parse the input code based on predefined grammar rules. It constructs a syntax tree representing the structure of the code. Currently, it supports parsing simple language constructs such as if statements, repeat statements, read and write statements, and assignment statements.

**How to Use:**

1. **Input Code:** Begin by entering your code snippet in the designated code area. The system will immediately start scanning and parsing the input as you type.

2. **Scanner Output:** As you input code, the scanner component dynamically updates to display the recognized tokens and their corresponding categories. This allows you to observe how the scanner breaks down the code into meaningful units.

3. **Parser Output:** Simultaneously, the parser attempts to analyze the syntactic structure of the code and constructs a syntax tree representation. The resulting syntax tree is displayed in JSON format, aiding in visualizing the code's hierarchical structure.

**Conclusion:**

Our language scanner and parser project provide a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in understanding the processes involved in lexical analysis and syntactic parsing. Whether you're exploring compiler design concepts or developing your own language, this tool offers a hands-on approach to dissecting code and comprehending its underlying structure.
